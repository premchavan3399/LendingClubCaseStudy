## General Information
- Background: The aim of the case study is to identify applicants who are likely to default using EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis).
- Business Problem: A large online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans,  wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. 
- Dataset: The data contains records of loans issued, including fields such as issue month and loan amounts. The primary analysis revolves around the total number of loans issued per month.

## Conclusions
- In this analysis of Lending Club loan data, we aimed to identify the key factors influencing loan defaults through a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
- The univariate and segmented univariate analyses revealed that factors such as loan amount, interest rate, employment length, and DTI are critical indicators of loan defaults. 
- Combining these insights in the bivariate analysis further strengthened the findings, confirming that higher-risk borrowers typically took larger, higher-interest loans and had shorter employment histories or higher financial burdens.
